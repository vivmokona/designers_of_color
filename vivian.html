    <h3>What intrigued you to Design & why did you choose the field you are in now?</h3>
    <p>The ability to be creative while also getting the chance to solve problems in which I can help others! I chose this field because I didn't know what career path I wanted to pursue when I first began college. Eventually through some trial and error I found design to be a field that I really enjoyed and actually saw myself pursing for the rest of my life.</p>

    <h3>What have been your biggest struggles of your career?</h3>
    <p>I think the biggest struggle has been building up the skills to become a designer. School only taught me so much, and it has mostly been a learn-as-you go and when you're on the job type of thing. Another struggle that is up-and-coming is actually finding satisfaction in my job, I am wondering if I would ever change career paths because sometimes graphic design isn't as satisfying as I don't feel like I am creating a big impact through my graphics.</p>

    <h3>What have your experiences been like as a person of color in the design industry? Does those experiences shape how you solve design-related problems?</h3>
    <p>As a person of color I've been fortune enough to have others support me, but I have experienced racism and discrimination just being who I am. Such as under-selling myself and having others be skeptical of my skill sets. These experiences have taken me aback, but with this I learn to be more empathetic to those who have it tougher than me. It definitely has made me a more resilient human being and even shapes the way I think, act, and design.</p>

    <h3>How can design be more accommodating to underrepresented populations of people?</h3>
    <p>Design can be more accommodating by providing equitable opportunities. I am talking about job opportunities. Yes there may be equal opportunities, but people of different backgrounds may not have received the same level of education or funding to achieve a certain level of work. Employers should not just ignore someone for their lack of ability, instead employers should learn about one's background and see that they have a potential to grow as a way of decision-making. Any field of design should make an effort to include more people of different backgrounds for user-testing and when it comes to solving a design problem. Like factor in qualities like how they grew up, their class, ethnicity, any disabilities, age, gender, their struggles, etc, to have better inclusive design.</p>
