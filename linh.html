    <h3>What intrigued you to Design & why did you choose the field you are in now?</h3>
    <p>I thought that designers had the ability to make the world around them more beautiful and i wanted to be apart of that world. I chose graphics because it felt like a happy medium between design and my love for drawing, painting, and illustration.</p>

    <h3>What have been your biggest struggles of your career?</h3>
    <p>The biggest struggle in my career is finding a full time job that wonâ€™t take advantage of me and under pay me.</p>

    <h3>What have your experiences been like as a person of color in the design industry? Does those experiences shape how you solve design-related problems?</h3>
    <p>I often find it hard to relate to many famous designers in history because they have been predominately white.</p>

    <h3>How can design be more accommodating to underrepresented populations of people?</h3>
    <p>We can be more accommodating to underrepresented populations of people by having doscussions of their accomplishments and bringing more awareness to them.</p>
