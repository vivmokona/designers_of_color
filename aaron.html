    <h3>What intrigued you to Design & why did you choose the field you are in now?</h3>
    <p>I was never really interested in Design till my senior year of High School where we had a simple Graphic Design class. I took it for units and grew to love it because of the endless creativity and freedom I felt from just doing homework. As I went through college UX/UI struck me as something I was more into as I went through classes and done my own research.</p>

    <h3>What have been your biggest struggles of your career?</h3>
    <p>The biggest struggle for me is having to chose between family and my career. Having a big ties to my family for who I am puts a lot of strain and stress on the work I do. When I was in a group project for one of my classes I had a situation where I had to be with my family and needed my group to continue working without me for the time being. Sadly that didn't work out that way and I had moments where I needed to decide if I could do all this work or be with my family. I did both which was a huge strain on my health.</p>

    <h3>What have your experiences been like as a person of color in the design industry? Does those experiences shape how you solve design-related problems?</h3>
    <p>I guess that word would be interesting. I've been through a few moments where clients would question my ability in design. As an Asian, a lot of people (in my area) see me as someone doing something greater than design or running with tradition and it gets pretty annoying and tiresome but that's just a few people in one town verse a whole country. So I don't think too much about it.</p>

    <h3>How can design be more accommodating to underrepresented populations of people?</h3>
    <p>I feel like design can open a lot of possiblites to problems that haven't been solved yet. Design can be used to tell a story and to be people together or awareness depending on how itâ€™s used. These sort of ideas can help benefit the populations that are well represented depending on those situations.</p>
