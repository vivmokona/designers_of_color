    <h3>What intrigued you to Design & why did you choose the field you are in now?</h3>
    <p>Design inspires me in terms of its ability impact human lives. As designers we create things for our audiences' consumption from which they hopefully gain something to enrich their lives. My love for cars attracted me to the field initially. Looking
      further into the field I realized how impactful transportation is to daily life, how it promotes mobility, which in turn can enhance productivity. It also heavily influences lifestyle and culture.</p>

    <h3>What have been your biggest struggles of your career?</h3>
    <p>Learning to take criticism with a good, positive, and learning mindset. Critique can hurt, especially if someone says "I hate it" point blank to your face. No matter through school rejections, job fumbles, or class critique, maintaining an open mind
      to learn something from whatever people have had to say about my work has been very beneficial towards my growth and tenacity as a designer.</p>

    <h3>What have your experiences been like as a person of color in the design industry? Does those experiences shape how you solve design-related problems?</h3>
    <p>Specifically in my field of design, I have yet to experience significant difference in treatment due to my skin color. I have surprised the occasional white American with my English given my international schooling background. In terms of opportunity
      I haven't been denied any based on my race so far.</p>

    <h3>How can design be more accommodating to underrepresented populations of people?</h3>
    <p>Design works in systems, and societal systems are where underrepresentation can be found. In society there are systematic hierarchies that influence who gets more opportunity/representation and who gets less. Design can work to accommodate the underrepresented
      through targeting systems. It could be through the apps we use, message campaigns, daily necessities, and more. Through systems we can influence people's habits and knowledge, working to create a more level platform for all people.</p>
